// The SuggestedBugName should be unique enough to differentiate conceptually different crashes, but generic enough that slight variations in the exception or crash stack still results in the same SuggestedBugName.
// The logic is to combine the innermost exception in the first line of the crash, which should be the most relevant exception if there are aggregated exceptions,
// and the innermost BuildXL function name of the stack trace, which should be the most specific but still relevant source of the crash.
