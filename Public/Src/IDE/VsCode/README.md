# BuildXL DScript IDE

## Debugging with VSCode
Step by step:
> Install NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

> code Public\Src\IDE\VsCode\client

> Hit F5
(it opens Extension Development Window, where you can open folder, open .dsc files etc). No need to ever install vsix for debugging

- Note: VSCode should install all the node modules that you need.. but if not you can just do "npm install" in the client folder (where the package.json is)

> In the Extension Development Window, go to any DScript folder or project, and party!
