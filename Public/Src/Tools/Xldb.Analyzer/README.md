# Xldb Analyzer

This is a hello world entry point for using Xldbs.
The goal of this is to be the "HelloWorld" app or entry-point that a consumer can use to analyze the xldb instance **OR** can use as inspiration for creating their own analyzers.
When built, the resulting exe can be found under `Out\Bin\Debug\tools\XldbAnalyzer\win-x64\xldbanalyzer.exe`.

* You do NOT need to add code to this file. It is merely meant to guide you. 
    * If you would like to add any code, we will look at the PR and add it, but you have now been given the freedom to do any analyzing you want on your own machines without being tied to our codebase.
    * We recommend this second path.
