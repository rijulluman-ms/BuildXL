    A filtered build was requested but the specified filter did not match any pips. This generally means the filter was misconfigured. The filter specified on the command line was: [FILTER]

A build is scoped using a pip filter specified by the `/f` or `/filter` command line option. This error occurs when the specified filter applied to the build doesn't match any pips.

If you didn't knowingly set the filter yourself, an upstream caller of bxl.exe likely set the filter. In WDG, db.exe sets a filter based on the current directory. If you see this error when using db.exe, it means that there are no pips to run in the current directory. Some non-obvious causes of this are:
* The directory you are building is a different architecture than your razzle window
* The pips that do exist in the directory are excluded in the filter. For example, if the directory only has Pass3 pips, they are excluded by the db.exe generated filter by default.
