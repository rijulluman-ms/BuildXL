This error is recorded when a file is accessed under a source sealed directory that is marked as "top only". Source sealed directories allow you to access any contained file without specifying it individually. "Top only" means that only the files directly within the top level of the source sealed directory can be accessed. 


So in the example below, they may have been a top only source sealed directory at E:\src\rs3db\analog\input\mirage. But access to the aggregatedtelemetryhelper.h file was not allowed because it was deeply nested under the "inc" directory.

    error DX0377: [PipA029F132AA9356FC, build.exe, MsWin.Holographic.Analog.Input.Mirage.Unittests.Endtoend_Pass1, Disabled-Release-X64] This pip accessed file under 'E:\src\rs3dp\analog\Input\mirage\inc\aggregatedtelemetryhelper.h' nested deeply within a top only source sealed directory."
