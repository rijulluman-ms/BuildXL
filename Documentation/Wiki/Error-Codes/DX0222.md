    warning DX0222: The file 'd:\dbs\sh\o1702\0309_024119\DominoDropConfig.json' is being used as a source file, but is not under a defined mountpoint. This file is thus 'untracked', and changes to it will not impact incremental builds.
```
This warning occurs when a file that's declared as an input to a process falls outside of a defined mount. Mounts are drives or directories with properties associated with them, such as whether they are readable, writeable, or tracked. Files under untracked mounts (includes files that don't belong to any mount) are not hashed and do not contribute to a process pip's fingerprint.


So the warning is basically saying that is the file changes, consuming pips will not be rerun due to the configuration.
