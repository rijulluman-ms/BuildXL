BuildXL has an optimization where it utilizes the NTFS change journal to cache a machine lookup of file change number to file content hash. This allows BuildXL to avoid re-hashing files that are unchanged build over build.

In order for this caching to be effective, BuildXL flushes the file to the file buffer before capturing the change number of a file using NtFlushBufferFileEx(). If the buffer were not flushed, the change version would be incorrect and once the buffer were eventually flushed naturally, the cached entry would be updated invalidating the cache.

This message does not indicate any kind of correctness issue. It is non-fatal and is only logged as a hint for performance optimization.
