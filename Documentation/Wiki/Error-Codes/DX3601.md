Some inputs are not known until after a pip runs. Those inputs are known as "observed inputs". Processing observed inputs requires that BuildXL can compute the content hash of the file. This error is displayed when BuildXL cannot compute the content hash of an observed input.


The reason it cannot compute the hash is because the file is under a mount that is configured to disallow hashing. In the example, the mount is called 'WindowsPublicRoot'. Enable the 'TrackSourceFileChanges' setting for the mount to allow hashing files contained within it.


     error DX3601: [PipCE9151FD83DBF4CA, build.exe, MsWin.Holographic.Analog.Input.Common.Test.Groundtruth.Charon.Semanticlabeling_Pass1, Disabled-Debug-X64] Processing observed input is aborted
                because failure in computing the hash of 'D:\build\out\src\rt\pub.amd64chk\sdk\ref\system.management.automation.metadata_dll'. The file is possibly untracked and under mount
                'WindowsPublicRoot' with hashing disabled.
