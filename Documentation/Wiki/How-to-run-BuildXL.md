# BuildXL Command Line
You can run BuildXL by running bxl.exe on the folder you want to run. You can get a list of all the standard options you can use with BuildXL using the command ```bxl.exe /help``` from your BuildXL folder. If you want to know about all the commands including advanced options, run the  ```bxl.exe /help:verbose``` command. Please be careful when you use advanced options since your team might already have defaults for them to prevent you from hurting yourself.

Command line options may be specified more than once. Depending on the option they will either be additive or last wins. For example the `/traceinfo` option allows annotating BuildXL's telemetry stream with additional data. You may want to make multiple annotations so the option can be specified multiple times with each adding more data. The `/CacheGraph` option controls whether the feature is on or off. So its final configuration will be based on the last time it is specified on the command line.

Response files are supported for long command lines: `bxl.exe @ResponseFilePath`
