The below logs and stat files get generated when BuildXL runs. These file names could be different based on the settings passed to bxl.exe.

* [BuildXL.log](./Log-Files/BuildXL.log.md)
* BuildXL.err - This file contains all the errors generated by the BuildXL build.
* BuildXL.warn - This file contains all the warnings generated by the BuildXL build.
* [BuildXL.stats](./Log-Files/BuildXL.stats.md)
* [BuildXL.xlg](./Log-Files/BuildXL.xlg.md) - This file is the execution log of the BuildXL run. You can use tools such as the [Execution Analyzer](../Advanced-Features/Execution-analyzer.md) to do a deeper analysis of the BuildXL run.
* BuildXL.statsprf.json - This file contains low-level runtime performance information. BuildXL logs total active time of several counters in a hierarchical way. If the build has not finished yet, the file contains outstanding stacks. Therefore, it is useful to troubleshoot the hanging builds. After the build is finished, the file also contains the longest running stacks that are useful to troubleshoot the slow builds.
* BuildXL.status.csv - BuildXL regularly logs build status information to this CSV file every specified seconds (default: 2) during the build. Some of the information that this file contains: Resource (cpu, mem, disks, network) usage, number of pips in each pip state and execution step, worker usage statistics (acquired slots, status, etc.), scheduler statistics. 
* BuildXL.CacheMiss.log - This file contains the detailed reasons of the cache misses if [Runtime Cache Miss Analysis](../Advanced-Features/Cache-Miss-Analysis.md) feature is enabled.
* BuildXL.Dev.log - This file is a small subset of [BuildXL.log](./Log-Files/BuildXL.log.md). As the main log can be sometimes very large, developers skim over *Dev.log* to troubleshoot issues. 
* BuildXL.DistributionRpc.log - This file contains the communication logs between master and workers if distributed build is enabled.
* BuildXL.PipOutput.log - This file contains the process pip output messages.
